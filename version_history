# V6 
* signal weighted centroid-centroid distance measurement
* added angle calc

# V5 probe_size = 4-100 and top_points = 30

# V4 (V3 is better)probe_size 10-30 and top_points = 40

# V3 (very good NCI performance, .8-.9, better HLB ~.5)
* Maximal projection
* set number of pixels per nuclei for spot thresholding vs quantile method (nuclei size impacts)

# V2
* per nuclei probe spot thresholding
* overlay image

# V1
* pipeline runs - mostly edge case handling
